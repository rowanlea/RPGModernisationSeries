# Database Setup

## Info
Dummy data created by [mockaroo](https://www.mockaroo.com/)

This was purposefully set up without a "proper" schema to allow the possibility of demonstrating using one later.

## To Run
To be run locally, hence the plain text "localhost" connection strings.

Just compile the dotnet code and run the .exe, or run it from your IDE, everything relevant gets run automatically.
